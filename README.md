# Ozzis_Addon
A simple addon that adds Media (fonts, backgrounds, textures, etc) for ElvUI or SharedMedia addons and additional slash commands and functions for better quality of life.

I have implemented a huge change, hopefully for the better. I have decided to split the commands out to their individual file. If you don't want a specific command you can simply disable it by editing the .toc file and placing a # in front of it. e.g., #Modules\cvars.lua
I have optimized some of the commands that taint in clients such as Classic Wrath, where now they will be ignored. I have also resolved dungeon / raid difficulties, these will now detect which client and then present the appropriate commands.
